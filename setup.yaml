# To obtain the data for the capstone project, follow these steps:

# 1. Create or log in to your Kaggle account and access your account settings.
# 2. Navigate to the API section on the account page.
# 3. Create a new API token, which will download a file named kaggle.json.
# 4. Upload the kaggle.json file to a folder called 'kaggle' in your Google Drive.
# 5. In a Google Colab notebook, use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/drive')

# 6. Create a directory named '.kaggle' in the root directory:

# !mkdir /root/.kaggle

# 7. Copy the 'kaggle.json' file from your Google Drive to the '.kaggle' directory:

# !cp /content/drive/MyDrive/kaggle/kaggle.json /root/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# 8. Set permissions to protect your API key:

# !chmod 600 /root/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# 9. Finally, download the dataset 'heart-failure-prediction' using the Kaggle API:

# !kaggle datasets download -d fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

# 10. Unzip the downloaded dataset and place it in the specified location in Google Drive:

# !unzip heart-failure-prediction.zip -d /content/drive/MyDrive/kaggle/heart-failure-prediction
